            Hi! My name is Jan, and I am based out of Manila in the Philippines.
            I am currently the Chief Product Officer of Smile API, a service to
            allow employees to easily share their employment and income data
            from various platforms and employers, all through a single API. At
            Smile, I am responsible for product and marketing strategy, product
            development, and user experience. <br />
            <br />
            Prior to Smile, I was the Chief Technologist at DXC for Southeast
            Asia, a global Systems Integrator. Previously I was also Director
            for Product Management at Oracle NetSuite where I led international
            product strategy in the Asia Pacific region. I have consulted for,
            and have held, senior management positions at several technology
            startups, software and systems integration and technology consulting
            companies. <br />
            <br />I am a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner and Scrum
            Master, I hold an ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service
            Management, a degree in Business Administration and Accounting, and
            a Master's Degree in Entrepreneurship from the Asian Institute of
            Management. I am also a Certified Public Accountant.
